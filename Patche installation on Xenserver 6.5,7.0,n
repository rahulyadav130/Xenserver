Why we need to install Xenserver patches ?
  many bugs fixed in particular xenserver version and devloper publiushed new code in the patches, that we need to just apply in infra.
  
  
  # Note- first we need to install patches on master node of pool and later worker node.
  
  
  
  1. Download the patches from citrix portal for required xenserver version.
  2. Copy the downloaded XenServer update to the XenServer host. If in a pool, apply the hotfix to the pool master. Tools such as WinSCP can allow for files to be copied from a Microsoft Windows system to a Linux system
  from widnwos machine we can use winscp to copy patches.
  3. unzip all the patches.
  4. xe patch-upload file-name=<Path of file and name>
  Example- xe patch-upload file-name=XS56ESP2006.xsupdate 
  5. above command will return a uuid that we need tocopy -
  6 xe patch-list | more ######### .  this is only for check.
  7. xe patch-apply uuid=<UUID of the patch> host-uuid=<UUID of the host>
  # above setep, uuid= the uuid which we copied when upload patches, host-uuid- node uuid.
